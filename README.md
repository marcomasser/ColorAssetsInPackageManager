# MyColors

This is a sample project to demonstrate an issue where SPM does not correctly handle image sets in asset catalogs.

See this Swift Forums post for details: https://forums.swift.org/t/does-spm-support-colors-in-asset-catalogs/54941

This reposiroty contains the relevant build products:
- SPM only copies the files: [Build Products/SPM/](https://github.com/marcomasser/ColorAssetsInPackageManager/tree/main/Build%20Results/SPM)
- Xcode compiles the files into an asset catalog: [Build Products/Xcode/](https://github.com/marcomasser/ColorAssetsInPackageManager/tree/main/Build%20Results/Xcode)
